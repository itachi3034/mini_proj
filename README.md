AI Prediction: Predicts Actual_Lifespan_Yrs, Maintenance_Cost, and Task_Completion_Time.

Financial Analysis: Calculates ROI, Net Profit, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for bulk purchases.

Blockchain Ledger: Records every "Recommended" or "Rejected" decision into a tamper-proof local blockchain.

Dual Modes: Run as a simple Python script or a full interactive Web App.
